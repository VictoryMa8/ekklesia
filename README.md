# Ekklesia ðŸª¬

In ancient Greece, the assembly of citizens in a Polis (city-state) was responsible for making decisions and governing the community.

Ekklesia allows users to manage their tasks (Kaleo) and create study timers (Synedria) that promote good habits.

Currently in development. If you want to try out the app, just message me or try this link: https://ekklesia-7ek1.onrender.com/.
