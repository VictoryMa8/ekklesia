# Ekklesia ðŸª¬

In ancient Greece, the assembly of citizens in a Polis (city-state) was responsible for making decisions and governing the community.

Ekklesia allows users to manage tasks (Kaleo) and create timers (Synedria) that promote good study habits. It is a simple web app powered by Django, HTMX, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, and Docker.
